# Various_Projects
Just some code that I put together. This will transform to something that will enable others to utilize to help their work.

Please note that I will do the stand alone codes first and then I will add in various codes that make the code look cleaner. The reason for the code being together in one long 1200 etc line block is so that it can be run easily. 

This is also ignoring the git ignore function for now since this is focused on running codes from the computer and that extra part might confuse someone for now.
